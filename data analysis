Code snippet
# Calculate the total runs scored by each player
df['Total Runs'] = df['Runs'].sum()

# Calculate the total wickets taken by each player
df['Total Wickets'] = df['Wickets'].sum()

# Calculate the average batting and bowling scores for each player
df['Average Batting'] = df['Runs'] / df['Matches']
df['Average Bowling'] = df['Wickets'] / df['Matches']

# Calculate the strike rate and economy rate for each player
df['Strike Rate'] = df['Runs'] / df['Balls Faced']
df['Economy Rate'] = df['Runs'] / df['Overs Bowled']

# Calculate the best bowling and batting figures for each player
df['Best Bowling'] = df['Best Bowling'].astype(int)
df['Best Score'] = df['Best Score'].astype(int)
