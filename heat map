Creating a heatmap of the results over the years:
Code snippet
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a figure and axes
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Plot the data as a heatmap
ax.pcolormesh(df.set_index('Year').T)

# Set the title and axis labels
plt.title('Overall Performance of Players')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Player')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
This code will create a heatmap of the results over the years. The heatmap will show how the overall performance of players has changed over time.
